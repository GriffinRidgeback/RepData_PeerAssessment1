## Loading and preprocessing the data

activity  <- read.csv("./data/activity.csv", stringsAsFactors = F)
summary(activity)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
library("dplyr")
complete_days_only  <- activity[complete.cases(activity), ]

step_summary  <- complete_days_only %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(daily_step_count = sum(steps))

hist(step_summary$daily_step_count, 
    main = "Histogram of total steps per day",
    xlab = "Total number of steps",
    ylab = "Number of instances",
    border = "green",
    col = "wheat",
    las = 1,
    ylim = c(0, 30))

```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
